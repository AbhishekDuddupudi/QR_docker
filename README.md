# Homework 7
# Docker and Python QR Code Generator

This project uses Docker and Python to generate a QR code PNG file that contains a URL. When scanned with a phone camera, the QR code directs users to my GitHub homepage: [https://github.com/AbhishekDuddupudi](https://github.com/AbhishekDuddupudi).
